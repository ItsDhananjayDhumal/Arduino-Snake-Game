## Description
We made snake game on Arduino UNO and displayed it on 128 x 64 OLED screen. Nothing is hard coded, so the speed, girth of snake can be changed by changing the values of defined variables. Code also works with different OLED screen sizes, just change the `SCREEN_HEIGHT` and `SCREEN_WIDTH` variables. This code is written for I2C protocol but if you aree using SPI, check my [pong game](https://github.com/ItsDhananjayDhumal/Arduino-Pong-Game-on-OLED/) repo and copy paste the part marked for SPI.

## Hardware
> * 128 x 64 OLED Screen
> * Arduino UNO
> * Joystick
> * Jumper wires

im too lazy to complete this readme file, just copy paste the code into arduino and check hardware connections from my [pong game](https://github.com/ItsDhananjayDhumal/Arduino-Pong-Game-on-OLED/) repo
